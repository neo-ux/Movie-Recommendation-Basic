# Movie-Recommendation-Basic
🎬 Movie Recommendation System  A content-based movie recommender system built with Python and Streamlit that suggests movies based on genre, director, cast, and overview. Users can interactively filter recommendations by genre using radio buttons. The project uses NLP techniques (TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity) for content analysis.
